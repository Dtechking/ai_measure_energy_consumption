# ⚡ AI Measure Energy Consumption


## 📝 Problem Statement
The project aims to create an automated system to measure energy consumption, analyze the data, and provide visualizations to support decision-making. This solution enhances efficiency, accuracy, and understanding in managing energy usage across various sectors.


## 🚀 Phases of the Project
- **Phase 1: Problem Definition and Design Thinking**  
  🔍 Identify key metrics for energy consumption analysis.

- **Phase 2: Transformation Plan**  
  🛠 Define tools and libraries needed for data analysis and visualization.

- **Phase 3: Development Part 1**  
  💻 Implement data loading and pre-processing, and perform basic analysis.

- **Phase 4: Development Part 2**  
  🎨 Integrate advanced visualization techniques and finalize the solution.


## 🏗 Project Structure
- `data_analysis.py`: 📊 Analyzes energy consumption patterns (e.g., daily, weekly, and monthly usage).
- `data_loader.py`: 📂 Loads and processes the dataset.
- `visualize_data.py`: 📈 Generates visualizations for energy consumption trends.
- `main.py`: 🚦 The entry point of the system, orchestrates loading, analyzing, and visualizing the data.


## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/AI-Measure-Energy-Consumption.git
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py

## 📊 Visualization Results
- **Data Comparison**:  
  🆚 Visualizes training and test data on the same graph, enabling stakeholders to compare past consumption trends with current usage.

- **Temporal Analysis**:  
  ⏳ Analyzes energy consumption over time (hours, days, months).

- **Data Distribution**:  
  📐 Displays the spread and variability of energy consumption.

- **Trends and Outliers**:  
  🔍 Detects and visualizes significant patterns or anomalies in the energy data.

## 📂 Dataset
The project uses hourly energy consumption data files (e.g., `AEP_hourly.csv`, `COMED_hourly.csv`, etc.). Ensure the dataset is available in the specified directory before running the scripts.
